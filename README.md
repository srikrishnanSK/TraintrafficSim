Train Traffic Signalling system
=======================================
* Bit about the system design *


How to build the project
=========================
1. Clone the project on to any linux based environment (preferrably Ubuntu as this has been tested with the same) with the command git clone <URL provided by the repository>.
2. cd to build directory.
3. run make.
4. ./traintrafficsimulation to view the actual simulation.

The binary has been compiled with -g flag for it to be used with gdb debugger. This should help debug critical issues such as nullptr expection.
